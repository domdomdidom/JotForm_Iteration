# JotForm_Iteration

These are a few custom BI functions I coded to answer questions for other departments. These were written before I had much formal training in Python. They aim to extract useful insights out of BigCommerce data.

It's a bit cringey to see code written outside of functions, using ascii.read instead of pd.read, the lack of an " if __name__ == 'main' " code block and SO many other things, but it has been refreshing and inspiring to come revisit these and see how much I've improved in less than a year!

I may update these if I get the time, but since I no longer work here, I don't have tons of incentive to do so. These projects would be a much better fit for SQL!
