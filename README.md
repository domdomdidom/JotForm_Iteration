# JotForm_Iteration

These are a few custom BI functions I coded to answer questions for other departments. They aim to extract useful insights out of BigCommerce (our eCom platform) data. These were written before I had much formal training in Python. 

It's a bit cringey to see code written outside of functions, using ascii.read instead of pd.read, the lack of an " if __name__ == 'main' " code block and SO many other things, but it has been refreshing and inspiring to come revisit these and see how much I've improved in less than a year!

__PLEASE__ take a look at [my Galvanize Capstone](https://github.com/domdomdidom/capstone_public) that explores the same data in a much, much more well-written fashion.

I may update these if I get the time, but since I no longer work here, I don't have tons of incentive to do so. These projects would be a much better fit for SQL!
